## What is Gatsby.js?

Gatsby is a Static Site Generator(SSG) written in [React.js](https://react.dev/).
Gatsby compiles your site, and uses preloading for the pages, so the rendered site is very fast.

## tl;dr
The good? Great performance, SEO, and image optimization. Built in graphql interface is very powerfull. A lot of plugins are available for just about everything.
The bad? Complex code and slow developer start (go get some coffee, it's going to take a couple of minutes).
The ugly? graphql queries for all the good stuff, not beginner friendly.

## The Data Layer

Gatsby uses a data layer model to query data for pages. It uses [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)

This is how to make a page query in Gatsby.

``` js
query ($id: String) {
  mdx(id: {eq: $id}) {
    frontmatter {
      date(formatString: "MMMM D, YYYY")
      hero_image_alt
      hero_image_credit_link
      hero_image_credit_text
      hero_image {
        childImageSharp {
          gatsbyImageData
        }
      }
      title
    }
  }
}
```

## Images

### gatsby-plugin-image

Using [gatsbpy-plugin-image](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/built-in-components/gatsby-plugin-image) you can get preproccessed images for your site. This is one of my main reasons to choose Gastby.


#### Image Properties

- layout
  - "constrained"
  - "fixed"
  - "fullWidth"

#### Static Images

```js
import {StaticImage} from "gatsby-plugin-image"
```

<br/>

```js
<StaticImage
  src="./my-image.jpg"
  alt="A lovely bunch of coconuts"
/>
```

<br/>

#### Dynamic Images

```js
import {GatsbyImage, getImage} from "gatsby-plugin-image"
```

getImage() is a helper function that takes *gatsbyImageData*;

```js
<GatsbyImage image={image}/>
```

You will have to write a graphql query for the images, but all optimization will be handled automatically.

Toggle the childImageSharp field, and then check the box for the gatsbyImageData field.

```js
query ($id: String) {
  mdx(id: {eq: $id}) {
    frontmatter {
      title
      date(formatString: "MMMM D, YYYY")
      hero_image_alt
      hero_image_credit_link
      hero_image_credit_text
      hero_image {
        childImageSharp {
          gatsbyImageData
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Blog

Setting up blog pages is a breeze using Gatsby. Set up a dynamic page template, and your markdown files will be converted to pages. Using [gatsby-plugin-mdx](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-mdx/), you can even add jsx to your markdown!

## Deployment

Gatsby is now a part of [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), so if you're deploying there you can connect to your gitHub account and run builds automatically.

## Conclusion

While the downsides (especially for beginners) are a bit much:), I think the benefits far out weigh them. I would recomend using Gatsby for your next website.
